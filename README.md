1. SudokuSolver is a C++ program that uses backtracking approach to find solution to a given Sudoku board.
2. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.
3. The time complexity of backtracking can be defined as O(K ^ N), where 'K' is the number of times the function calls itself.
4. The space complexity of backtracking can be defined as O(n).
